Case Study with R

This analysis is using the Fitbit data from 11/4/2016 to 12/5/2016.
The business task is to generate ideas to the products and marketing strategy, in order to help the company identify growth opportunities.

I have join three tables to one, change the data type and reformatted the tables.
I re-check the data types and completeness before analysis.

Check points in the analysis:-
1. Discrepancies between the hourly and daily records
2. Skewness of the data
3. Univariate analysis
4. Bivariate analysis
5. Trivariate analysis

After the analysis, I am able to answer the business questions with the observed trends and patterns.

I also combined my findings with an outer source, for the stakeholders reference.
