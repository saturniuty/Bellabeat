# Bellabeat
Case Study with R

<br>

## Summary
In this case study, I used FitBit Fitness Tracker Data to recognize human routine behavioral and pattern.
I was able to generate ideas to enhance *Bellabeat*'s product and influence the marketing strategy.

<br>

## Problems
Identify new growth opportunities for the company.

<br>

## Process
Check points in the analysis:-
1. Data cleaning
2. Discrepancies between the hourly and daily records
3. Skewness of the data
4. Univariate analysis
5. Bivariate analysis
6. Trivariate analysis

<br>


## Conclusion
More steps means longer the distance, more active time and higher intensity of the activity.

The more active time and higher intensity can lead to more calories burned.

Thus, daily walking can burn more calories and have other health benefits. Source here [link](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325323#takeaway)

<br>

Most calories burned between 7am to 9pm, especially from 2pm to 5pm.
